# Clubber TV Technical Interview Questions and Answers

## Backend (.NET/C#) Questions

### Architecture & Design

**Q: Explain the architecture pattern used in the backend and why it was chosen?**  
A: The backend uses Clean Architecture with distinct layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API). This approach provides clear separation of concerns, makes the system more testable, maintainable, and ensures business logic remains independent of external frameworks or databases. It allows us to change implementations (like swapping databases) without affecting the core business logic.

**Q: How does the application handle authentication and what security measures are implemented?**  
A: The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. After successful login, a token containing the user's identity claims is generated and returned to the client. The authentication flow includes password hashing with BCrypt, token-based authorization via the `[Authorize]` attribute, and claims-based identity using `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier` to identify the current user. The system also uses HTTPS and implements proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.

**Q: How is data persistence handled in the application?**  
A: The application uses Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence. The database schema is managed through EF Core migrations. The repository pattern abstracts data access operations, and there's a Unit of Work pattern that manages transactions and ensures data consistency. This setup allows for easy testing with in-memory databases and potential migration to other database providers in the future.

**Q: Describe how the API handles errors and edge cases.**  
A: The API implements RFC 7807-compliant error responses using the ASP.NET Core `Problem()` method. This provides a standardized error format that includes a title, detail, and status code. There's global exception handling middleware that catches unhandled exceptions, logs them, and returns appropriate error responses without exposing implementation details. Controllers have explicit validation and return appropriate status codes (400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access, 404 for not found resources).

### Implementation Details

**Q: How are the relationships between Users, Matches, and Playlists modeled in the database?**  
A: The database has three main entities: User, Match, and Playlist. The Playlist entity serves as a join table implementing a many-to-many relationship between Users and Matches. It has a composite primary key of UserId and MatchId, with foreign key constraints to both tables. It also includes a DateAdded timestamp to track when a match was added to a user's playlist. This design allows efficient querying of a user's playlist and prevents duplicate entries.

**Q: How does the application handle filtering and pagination for the matches API?**  
A: The `/api/v1/Matches` endpoint accepts query parameters for filtering by competition and status. It implements pagination using page and pageSize parameters with sensible defaults (page=1, pageSize=20). The API returns a PaginatedResult object containing the data for the current page, total count, total pages, and metadata for building navigation links. The implementation uses LINQ with Skip and Take operations for efficient database queries.

**Q: Explain how you would extend the application to support real-time notifications for match status changes.**  
A: The application already has the foundation for this with the Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. I would enhance the MatchesController's StreamMatches endpoint to maintain a persistent connection with clients. When a match status changes (e.g., from Upcoming to Live), I'd broadcast an event through the SseMatchNotifier. On the frontend, I'd implement an EventSource connection to listen for these events and update the UI accordingly. This provides real-time updates without the complexity of WebSockets.

**Q: How would you optimize the API for high traffic scenarios?**  
A: I would implement several optimizations:
1. Add response caching for non-personalized content
2. Implement database query optimization and indexing
3. Add pagination for all list endpoints (already implemented)
4. Set up rate limiting at the API gateway level
5. Consider a CDN for static content
6. Implement horizontal scaling for the API
7. Use in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
8. Optimize database access with efficient entity loading strategies
9. Consider separating read and write operations (CQRS pattern)

## Frontend (Angular) Questions

### Architecture & Design

**Q: Explain the state management approach used in the frontend and why it was chosen.**  
A: The frontend uses NgRx for state management, implementing the Redux pattern with actions, reducers, effects, and selectors. This approach was chosen because it provides a predictable state container with a unidirectional data flow, which makes the application more maintainable as it grows. NgRx helps manage complex application state, handle side effects like API calls efficiently, and enables powerful debugging tools. The store is organized into feature states (auth, matches, playlist) to maintain a modular structure.

**Q: How is the application structured in terms of modules and components?**  
A: The application follows a modular structure with feature modules (auth, matches, playlist, profile), shared module, and core module. The core module contains singleton services like authentication and HTTP interceptors. The shared module has reusable components, directives, and pipes. Feature modules are lazily loaded through the router to improve initial load time. Within each feature module, components follow a container/presentational pattern where container components connect to the store and handle logic, while presentational components focus on the UI.

**Q: Explain in detail how NgRx is implemented in the Clubber TV application.**  
A: The Clubber TV application implements NgRx for state management following a standard Redux pattern. Here's how it's structured:

1. **Store Architecture**:
   - Application state is divided into feature slices (auth, matches, playlist)
   - Each feature has its own state interface defined in files like `auth.state.ts`, `matches.state.ts`, and `playlist.state.ts`
   - The root state combines all feature states into a cohesive application state

2. **Key NgRx Components**:
   - **Actions** (`/store/actions/*.actions.ts`): Define events that can occur in the application. For example, `LoadMatches`, `AddToPlaylist`, or `Login`. Each action is a simple class with an optional payload.
   - **Reducers** (`/store/reducers/*.reducer.ts`): Pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action, and return a new state object without mutating the original.
   - **Effects** (`/store/effects/*.effects.ts`): Handle side effects like API calls. For example, when a `LoadMatches` action is dispatched, an effect might make an HTTP request and then dispatch either a success or failure action.
   - **Selectors** (`/store/selectors/*.selectors.ts`): Pure functions that extract specific pieces of state. For example, `selectAllMatches` or `selectCurrentUser`. They enable components to subscribe to the specific data they need.
   
3. **State Management Flow**:
   - Components inject the Store and dispatch actions (`store.dispatch(new LoadMatches())`)
   - Actions might trigger effects for API calls or other async operations
   - Reducers process actions and update the state
   - Components subscribe to selectors to get data from the store (`this.matches$ = this.store.select(selectAllMatches)`)
   - When state changes, components automatically re-render with new data

4. **Example Implementation for Matches Feature**:
   - **State** (`/store/state/matches.state.ts`): Defines the structure of the matches state slice, including properties like matchList, loading, and error status.
   - **Actions** (`/store/actions/matches.actions.ts`): Defines actions like `LoadMatches`, `LoadMatchesSuccess`, `LoadMatchesFailure`, `FilterMatches`, etc.
   - **Reducer** (`/store/reducers/matches.reducer.ts`): Handles state transitions for match-related actions, such as updating the match list when `LoadMatchesSuccess` is processed.
   - **Effects** (`/store/effects/matches.effects.ts`): Contains the logic for side effects like API calls. For example, when `LoadMatches` is dispatched, it calls the match service and dispatches either `LoadMatchesSuccess` or `LoadMatchesFailure`.
   - **Selectors** (`/store/selectors/matches.selectors.ts`): Provides functions to select match state from the store, like `selectAllMatches`, `selectMatchById`, or `selectLiveMatches`.

5. **Benefits in the Application**:
   - **Predictable State**: All state changes follow the same pattern, making debugging easier
   - **Separation of Concerns**: UI components are decoupled from data fetching and state management
   - **Performance**: Components only re-render when their specific slice of state changes
   - **Testability**: Actions, reducers, effects, and selectors can be tested in isolation
   - **Devtools Integration**: NgRx DevTools allow time-travel debugging and state inspection

The implementation follows NgRx best practices with a clear separation between state management and UI components, enabling a robust and maintainable application architecture.

**Q: Describe how authentication and route guards are implemented in the frontend.**  
A: Authentication is managed through an AuthService that handles login, registration, and token storage. The JWT token is stored (likely in localStorage or a similar mechanism) and attached to API requests via an HTTP interceptor. Route guards like AuthGuard protect routes that require authentication by checking if a valid token exists. The guard can redirect unauthenticated users to the login page. User state is stored in the NgRx store, making it accessible throughout the application while maintaining a single source of truth.

**Q: How does the application handle responsive design?**  
A: The application uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for consistent styling with responsive utility classes (like md:flex, lg:hidden) that adapt the UI based on screen size. Components are designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring they work well on small screens and then enhance the experience on larger screens. The layout uses flexbox and grid systems to create adaptable interfaces that work across devices.

### Implementation Details

**Q: Explain how the application interacts with the backend API.**  
A: The application uses Angular's HttpClient to make API calls to the backend. Service classes encapsulate API interactions, abstracting the HTTP details from components. These services return Observables that components can subscribe to. NgRx Effects handle side effects by listening for actions that require API calls, executing those calls, and dispatching new actions with the results. For authentication, an HTTP interceptor adds the JWT token to each request. Error handling is implemented through catchError operators and propagated to the UI via the store.

**Q: How would you implement real-time updates for match statuses in the frontend?**  
A: I would implement an EventSource connection to the server's SSE endpoint in a service. This service would listen for events from the server and dispatch NgRx actions to update the store when match status changes occur. Components would automatically reflect these changes as they're connected to the store via selectors. This approach ensures real-time updates while maintaining a consistent state management pattern. The service would handle reconnection logic and error scenarios to ensure a reliable connection.

**Q: Describe how you'd implement advanced filtering and sorting for the matches list.**  
A: I would enhance the UI with filter and sort controls that dispatch actions to update filter/sort criteria in the store. These criteria would be used to construct query parameters for API requests. The implementation would support both client-side filtering/sorting for small datasets and server-side for larger sets. I'd implement debouncing for text filters to avoid excessive API calls and add URL query parameter synchronization to make filtered views shareable and bookmarkable.

**Q: How would you improve the performance of the Angular application?**  
A: Several performance optimizations could be implemented:
1. Use OnPush change detection strategy for components
2. Implement trackBy functions in ngFor loops
3. Lazy load non-critical modules
4. Use virtual scrolling for long lists
5. Optimize bundle size with proper tree-shaking
6. Implement proper caching strategies for API responses
7. Use pure pipes instead of methods in templates
8. Preload strategically important modules
9. Optimize images and use appropriate formats (WebP)
10. Implement service workers for caching and offline support

## Business Understanding Questions

**Q: Why is a Playlist feature important for a sports streaming platform like Clubber TV?**  
A: The Playlist feature enhances user experience by allowing viewers to curate their own personalized collection of sports content. This increases user engagement and session time as users return to watch saved matches. It also provides valuable data on user preferences that can inform content acquisition and recommendation algorithms. Playlists create a sense of investment in the platform, reducing churn and increasing user retention.

**Q: What improvements or additional features would you suggest for the Playlist functionality?**  
A: Potential improvements include:
1. Smart notifications when a playlist match is about to go live
2. Playlist sharing capabilities between users
3. Auto-categorization of playlists based on sport/league
4. Watch progress tracking across devices
5. Personalized recommendations based on playlist content
6. Integration with calendar apps for upcoming matches
7. Offline viewing capability for playlist matches
8. Playlist folders/categories for organization
9. Automatic removal of watched content (optional)
10. Season/tournament following that automatically adds matches

**Q: How would you prioritize feature development for the next version of the application?**  
A: I would prioritize features based on:
1. User value - Features that directly improve core user experience
2. Business impact - Features that drive retention or monetization
3. Technical feasibility - Complexity vs. benefit analysis
4. Strategic alignment - Support for Clubber TV's long-term goals

Top priorities might include:
1. Enhancing the recommendation engine based on playlist behavior
2. Implementing live notifications for playlist matches
3. Adding social features like sharing playlists
4. Improving the mobile experience
5. Adding analytics to better understand user behavior

## Technical Concept Questions

**Q: Explain the benefits of using Clean Architecture in a .NET application.**  
A: Clean Architecture provides several benefits:
1. Separation of concerns - Business logic is isolated from infrastructure and UI concerns
2. Testability - Core business logic can be tested without external dependencies
3. Maintainability - Changes in external systems (DB, UI, etc.) don't affect business logic
4. Framework independence - The domain and application layers aren't tied to specific frameworks
5. Dependency direction - All dependencies point inward to the domain layer
6. Flexibility - Easy to swap implementations of interfaces (e.g., changing database providers)
7. Clear boundaries - Well-defined interfaces between layers
8. Focused responsibility - Each layer has a specific purpose

**Q: Compare and contrast different state management approaches in Angular applications.**  
A: Different state management approaches include:

1. **Services with BehaviorSubjects**:
   - Pros: Simple, lightweight, built into Angular, low learning curve
   - Cons: Can become unwieldy for complex state, no strict patterns for updates

2. **NgRx (Redux pattern)**:
   - Pros: Predictable state, powerful debugging, clear update patterns, good for complex apps
   - Cons: Verbose, steep learning curve, potential over-engineering for simple apps

3. **NGXS**:
   - Pros: Less boilerplate than NgRx, class-based, easier transition from services
   - Cons: Less mature ecosystem than NgRx, still has learning curve

4. **Akita**:
   - Pros: Less boilerplate, query-based, entity adapter built-in
   - Cons: Smaller community, less documentation

5. **Component state with Input/Output**:
   - Pros: Simple, good for isolated components, follows Angular patterns
   - Cons: Not suitable for sharing state across unrelated components, can lead to prop drilling

The choice depends on application complexity, team familiarity, and specific requirements. This application chose NgRx due to its complex state needs and the benefits of a predictable state container.

**Q: Discuss the trade-offs between different database technologies for a sports streaming application.**  
A: Different database options include:

1. **Relational DB (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)**:
   - Pros: Strong consistency, good for complex relationships, mature tools, ACID compliance
   - Cons: Scaling can be complex, potential performance limitations for very high traffic

2. **Document DB (MongoDB)**:
   - Pros: Flexible schema, potentially easier horizontal scaling, good for heterogeneous data
   - Cons: Less suitable for complex relationships, eventual consistency challenges

3. **Graph DB (Neo4j)**:
   - Pros: Excellent for complex relationships, good for recommendation engines
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve, specialized use cases

4. **Time-Series DB (InfluxDB)**:
   - Pros: Optimized for metrics and analytics data, good for usage statistics
   - Cons: Not suitable as a primary application database

For a sports streaming application, a hybrid approach might work best: relational DB for user data and match metadata, potentially a document DB for flexible content metadata, and a time-series DB for analytics.

**Q: How would you approach implementing a recommendation system for sports content?**  
A: I would implement a multi-faceted recommendation system:

1. **Collaborative filtering**: Recommend content based on what similar users have watched
2. **Content-based filtering**: Recommend matches based on sports/teams the user has watched
3. **Temporal factors**: Prioritize upcoming/live matches of favorite teams
4. **Explicit preferences**: Allow users to follow teams, leagues, or athletes
5. **Implicit signals**: Watch history, partial views, playlist additions
6. **Contextual factors**: Time of day, day of week, device type
7. **Cold start handling**: Popular content and onboarding questionnaires for new users
8. **A/B testing framework**: To continuously improve recommendation quality

The system would need a feedback loop to evaluate recommendation quality through metrics like click-through rates, watch time, and explicit ratings.

## Specific Technology Questions

**Q: What are the key benefits of ASP.NET Core over previous .NET frameworks?**  
A: Key benefits include:
1. Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
2. Improved performance and scalability
3. Built-in dependency injection
4. Modular and lightweight framework
5. Unified MVC and Web API frameworks
6. Support for modern hosting models (Kestrel, Docker)
7. Built-in middleware pipeline
8. Configuration and environment system
9. Integrated logging framework
10. Better support for modern web development patterns

**Q: Explain Angular's change detection strategy and how to optimize it.**  
A: Angular's default change detection uses Zone.js to track asynchronous operations and trigger change detection. This can be optimized by:
1. Using OnPush change detection strategy for components
2. Using immutable objects or the immutable pattern
3. Detaching change detection for stable components
4. Using pure pipes instead of methods in templates
5. Leveraging trackBy in ngFor directives
6. Using async pipe to automatically handle subscriptions and change detection
7. Breaking up complex components into smaller ones
8. Using the run-outside-angular pattern for non-UI operations
9. Avoiding deep object comparisons

**Q: How does Entity Framework Core differ from other ORMs, and what are its advantages?**  
A: Entity Framework Core offers:
1. LINQ support for type-safe queries
2. Code-first or database-first approach
3. Migration system for database schema changes
4. Integration with ASP.NET Core's dependency injection
5. Cross-platform support
6. Lightweight and modular design
7. Improved performance over EF6
8. Multiple database provider support
9. Flexible model configuration
10. Batching capabilities for operations

Compared to other ORMs like Dapper, it offers higher-level abstractions but potentially at the cost of some performance. Compared to NHibernate, it has better integration with .NET Core but potentially fewer advanced features.

**Q: How is AutoMapper implemented in the Clubber TV application and what alternatives could be considered?**  
A: In the Clubber TV application, AutoMapper is likely configured in the Application layer to map between domain entities and DTOs. It's registered in the dependency injection container during startup, with mapping profiles defined for each entity-DTO pair. Alternatives to consider include: manual mapping methods, specialized mapping libraries like Mapster (which offers better performance), or expression tree-based mappers. For simpler applications, using C# records with copy constructors or extension methods for mapping can provide more explicit and potentially faster mapping without the overhead of a full mapping framework.

**Q: How would you handle complex mapping scenarios in AutoMapper, such as conditional mapping?**  
A: For complex scenarios like conditional mapping in AutoMapper, I would use a combination of techniques: custom value resolvers for properties that need specialized logic, `ForMember()` configurations with conditions using `.Condition()` method, type converters for transforming between incompatible types, and `AfterMap()` actions for post-processing. For very complex cases, I might create a specialized resolver class that encapsulates the complex logic while keeping the mapping profile clean. In some cases where mapping becomes too complex, it may be better to write a dedicated manual mapping method rather than forcing AutoMapper to handle it.

**Q: What are the performance implications of using AutoMapper in a high-traffic API like the match listing endpoint in Clubber TV?**  
A: AutoMapper introduces some performance overhead due to reflection, especially on frequently called endpoints like match listing. To mitigate this, I would: compile mapping configurations at startup using `.CompileMappers()`, use projection queries with `.ProjectTo<MatchDto>()` to map directly in the database query when possible, cache frequently used DTOs, and consider manual mapping for truly hot paths. Benchmarks have shown that libraries like Mapster can be 2-3x faster than AutoMapper, so for high-traffic endpoints, switching to a more performant mapper or hand-written mapping could be justified. The decision should be based on profiling results rather than premature optimization.

**Q: How would you test AutoMapper configurations in the Clubber TV application?**  
A: I would test AutoMapper configurations using: configuration validation with `.AssertConfigurationIsValid()` to verify all mappings are properly set up, unit tests that verify specific mapping scenarios (entity to DTO and vice versa), integration tests that ensure the entire mapping pipeline works correctly, and property-by-property assertions for complex mappings. For the Clubber TV application specifically, I'd write tests verifying that Match entities map correctly to MatchDto objects, ensuring that all required fields like title, competition, and status are properly mapped, and special attention would be given to enum mappings between backend and frontend representations.

**Q: Explain the JWT authentication algorithm used in the Clubber TV application and compare it with alternatives.**  
A: The Clubber TV application uses HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) with a SymmetricSecurityKey for JWT authentication. This approach uses the same secret key for both signing and validating tokens, which is simple to implement but requires secure distribution of the secret key to all services that need to validate tokens. The key is stored in appsettings.json with an option to override it using environment variables, following the configuration-over-code principle.

An alternative approach would be to use RSA (RS256), which is an asymmetric algorithm that uses a public/private key pair. With RS256, the tokens are signed with a private key and verified with a corresponding public key. This provides better security for distributed systems since the public key used for verification can be shared freely without compromising the private signing key. RS256 would be more appropriate for microservices architectures or when the token issuer and validator are separate systems. The current HS256 implementation is appropriate for the Clubber TV's monolithic architecture where both token generation and validation happen within the same application boundary.

**Q: Describe how you would implement efficient client-side caching in an Angular application.**  
A: Efficient client-side caching could be implemented through:
1. HTTP caching with appropriate headers and HttpClient's cache options
2. Custom caching service using RxJS operators like shareReplay
3. In-memory caching of API responses with TTL (time-to-live)
4. Service worker caching for offline support
5. NgRx/Store as a cache for application state
6. IndexedDB for larger dataset persistence
7. Versioned API responses to invalidate cache when data changes
8. Optimistic updates for improved perceived performance
9. Prefetching and background loading of likely-to-be-needed data
10. Implementing stale-while-revalidate patterns for frequently changing data
