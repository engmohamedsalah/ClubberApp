# ClubberApp - My Sports Playlist

 The web application serves as a solution to the "My Sports Playlist" challenge. Users can register  and log in to view sports matches from a mock source while managing their personal match playlist.

The application  implements Clean Architecture principles for backend development and NgRx state management in its Angular frontend.


## Business Understanding

### User Experience (UX)
The Playlist feature makes Clubber TV easier and more fun to use.  Users can save their favorite music, live sets, or interviews and organize them into lists (like  "Chill House Vibes" or "Techno Energy"). This helps them find content faster and enjoy  music that matches their mood or taste. It also lets users share playlists with friends, creating a sense  of community and making the platform feel more personal.

### Business Benefits
Playlists help Clubber TV keep  users coming back. When people create or follow playlists, they spend more time on the app, which  means they’re less likely to leave for other platforms. This also gives Clubber TV data about what  users like, so they can recommend better content or work with popular artists. Plus, playlists can be  used to promote new music or events, helping Clubber TV grow its audience and attract sponsors or advertisers.
 

## Setup Instructions

For a quick start with both frontend and backend development environments, use the `start-dev.sh` script located in the project root:
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```
For detailed setup instructions for the backend and frontend, please refer to their respective sections further down in this README:
*   [Backend Setup & Running](#backend-net)
*   [Frontend Setup & Running](#frontend-angular)

## API Documentation

The backend provides a RESTful API for user authentication, managing matches, and handling playlists. Key endpoints include:

*   `POST /api/Auth/register`: Register a new user.
*   `POST /api/Auth/login`: Log in an existing user, returns JWT.
*   `GET /api/Matches`: Get available matches (supports filtering and pagination).
*   `GET /api/Playlist`: Get the authenticated user's playlist.
*   `POST /api/Playlist/{matchId}`: Add a match to the user's playlist.
*   `DELETE /api/Playlist/{matchId}`: Remove a match from the user's playlist.

For more details on request/response formats and parameters, please refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section and the backend controller source code in `backend/ClubberApp.Api/Controllers/`.

## Development Scripts

For easier development, use these convenient scripts from the project root:

- **Start both servers:**
  ```bash
  ./start-dev.sh
  ```
  This starts both the .NET backend and Angular frontend servers in a single command.

- **Stop both servers:**
  ```bash
  ./stop-dev.sh
  ```
  This stops both servers and cleans up any processes.

These scripts handle proper process management and provide clear feedback about the running services.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** .NET 8, C#, ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core (for data persistence concept), AutoMapper, Clean Architecture, xUnit, Moq, BCrypt.Net (for password hashing), JWT (for authentication)
*   **Frontend:** Angular 19, TypeScript, NgRx (Store, Effects, Selectors), Tailwind CSS v3, RxJS, Karma, Jasmine

## Backend (.NET)

### Architecture

The backend follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers:

*   **Domain:** Contains core entities (`User`, `Match`, `Playlist`) and domain logic.
*   **Application:** Contains application logic, interfaces (repositories, services, unit of work), DTOs, and service implementations.
*   **Infrastructure:** Provides implementations for interfaces defined in the Application layer, such as repositories using EF Core (conceptual) and potentially external services.
*   **Api:** The ASP.NET Core Web API layer, responsible for handling HTTP requests, routing, controllers, and interacting with the Application layer.

### Setup & Running

1.  **Navigate to the API directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/clubber_app/backend/ClubberApp.Api
    ```
2.  **Restore dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore ../../ClubberApp.sln
    # The backend/.NET SDK version is pinned by backend/global.json
    ```
3.  **Database Setup (Conceptual):**
    *   This implementation uses an in-memory database for simplicity during development and testing. For a production scenario, you would configure a connection string in `appsettings.json` for a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
    *   EF Core migrations would be used to manage the database schema:
        ```bash
        # Add migration (run from Infrastructure project directory or specify with --project)
        dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --startup-project ../ClubberApp.Api
        # Apply migration (run from Api project directory)
        dotnet ef database update
        ```
4.  **JWT Configuration:**
    *   Update the `JwtSettings` section in `/home/ubuntu/clubber_app/backend/ClubberApp.Api/appsettings.json` with your own secret key, issuer, and audience.
    ```json
    "JwtSettings": {
      "Key": "YOUR_VERY_SECURE_SECRET_KEY_HERE_LONGER_THAN_32_BYTES",
      "Issuer": "YourAppIssuer",
      "Audience": "YourAppAudience"
    }
    ```
5.  **Run the API:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API will typically be available at `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001` (check console output).

### Running Backend Tests

1.  **Navigate to the solution root or tests directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/clubber_app
    ```
2.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```
    *Note: Some API integration tests might still have compilation errors related to `CustomWebApplicationFactory` accessibility that need resolving.*

### API Endpoints

*   `POST /api/Auth/register`: Register a new user.
*   `POST /api/Auth/login`: Log in an existing user, returns JWT.
*   `GET /api/Matches`: Get all available matches.
*   `GET /api/Playlist`: Get the authenticated user's playlist.
*   `POST /api/Playlist/{matchId}`: Add a match to the playlist.
*   `DELETE /api/Playlist/{matchId}`: Remove a match from the playlist.

## Frontend (Angular)

### Setup & Running

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/clubber_app/frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure API URL:**
    *   Update the `apiUrl` in `/home/ubuntu/clubber_app/frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` and `environment.development.ts` to point to your running backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Running Frontend Tests

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/clubber_app/frontend
    ```
2.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless
    ```
    *Note: The tests should now pass after the recent fixes. If issues persist, further debugging might be needed.*

## Next Steps & Improvements

*   **Implement Real Data Source:** Replace the mock match data source with a real one (e.g., fetch from a third-party API or a database).
*   **Database Persistence:** Fully implement database persistence using EF Core and a chosen database provider.
*   **EF Core Migrations:** Implement and manage database schema changes using EF Core migrations.
*   **API Integration Tests:** Fix the remaining compilation errors in the API integration tests.
*   **Frontend Test Coverage:** Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests for the frontend components, services, and NgRx store.
*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling on both backend and frontend.
*   **UI/UX:** Improve the user interface and user experience.
*   **Security:** Implement more robust security measures (e.g., input validation, rate limiting, HTTPS enforcement).
*   **Deployment:** Create build pipelines and deployment scripts.

## API Design & Best Practices

This backend API was designed with modern best practices in mind. Here is a summary of the key design decisions and their implementation status:

| Area                                    | Status      | Details/Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model validation                        | ✅ Done     | DTOs use `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`; `[ApiController]` enables validation |
| Consistent error handling                | ✅ Done     | All controllers use `Problem()` for RFC 7807-compliant error responses        |
| Pagination (Matches & Playlists)         | ✅ Done     | Generic `PaginatedResult<T>` used in both controllers and services            |
| Integration/unit testing                 | ✅ Done     | Integration tests for AuthController, including model validation              |
| Rate limiting                           | ✅ Gateway  | Rate limiting is NOT implemented in the API code; it is a gateway concern (e.g., NGINX, Azure API Management, AWS API Gateway) |
| Response caching                        | ✅ Done     | Middleware enabled (but not on health check)                                  |
| Secure secret management                 | ✅ Done     | JWT secret read from environment variable if available                        |
| Monitoring in health checks              | ✅ Done     | Health check endpoint checks DB connectivity                                  |
| Clean code for health checks             | ✅ Done     | Health logic moved to `HealthCheckService` and injected into controller       |
| Removal of obsolete TODOs                | ✅ Done     | All TODO comments removed from codebase                                       |
| Built-in ASP.NET Core health checks      | ⚠️ Optional | Custom service used; built-in system available for advanced scenarios         |

**App-level limits:**
- Rate limiting is NOT implemented in the API code. For production, it is recommended to enforce global limits at the API gateway (e.g., NGINX, Azure API Management, AWS API Gateway).

**Caching:**
- Response caching is enabled for suitable endpoints. Caching strategy (API, gateway, or CDN) should be discussed and tailored to business needs.
