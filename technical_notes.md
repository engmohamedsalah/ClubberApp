# Technical Decisions and Trade-offs Summary

## Backend Development

### 1. API Design & Principles
*   **Decision**: RESTful APIs with DTOs.
*   **Rationale**: Standardization, clear contracts, maintainability.
*   **Consideration**: Can be verbose for simple operations.

### 2. Clean Architecture
*   **Decision**: Layered architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API).
*   **Rationale**: Separation of concerns, testability, maintainability, framework independence.
*   **Consideration**: Higher initial setup effort; potential for over-engineering small projects.

### 3. API Versioning
*   **Decision**: URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
*   **Rationale**: Explicit, good for backward compatibility.
*   **Consideration**: Can lengthen URLs; managing multiple versions adds overhead.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
*   **Decision**: `[Authorize]` attribute with JWT claims (`ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier`).
*   **Rationale**: Simple, leverages built-in ASP.NET Core features.
*   **Consideration**: Best for .NET-managed identity; less flexible for complex SSO.

### 5. User Management
*   **Decision (Initial)**: Direct database management for user profiles.
*   **Rationale**: Simplicity for basic needs and rapid initial development.
*   **Consideration**: For advanced features (MFA, social logins) or microservices, a dedicated Auth Service (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0) is better for security and scalability.

### 6. Real-time Communication (e.g., Server-Sent Events - SSE)
*   **Context**: Not currently used.
*   **Potential Use**: For features needing server-to-client updates (e.g., notifications).
*   **Rationale (if used)**: Simpler than WebSockets for one-way data flow; HTTP-based.
*   **Consideration**: Unidirectional; browser connection limits.

### 7. Data Persistence
*   **Decision**: Utilize an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework Core with a relational database.
*   **Rationale**: Productivity via LINQ, schema migrations, handles boilerplate data access.
*   **Consideration**: ORM learning curve; performance tuning for complex queries; abstraction can sometimes hide SQL inefficiencies.

### 8. Backend Testing Strategy
*   **Decision**: Focus on unit tests for business logic (Application/Domain layers) and integration tests for API endpoints and data access.
*   **Rationale**: Ensures code correctness, prevents regressions, aids refactoring.
*   **Consideration**: Time investment for test creation/maintenance; defining appropriate test boundaries.

### 9. Global Exception Handling
*   **Decision**: Implement a middleware for global exception handling in the API.
*   **Rationale**: Catches unhandled exceptions, logs them, and returns standardized error responses (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error with a generic message), preventing stack traces from leaking to the client.
*   **Consideration**: Ensuring detailed logs are captured for diagnostics while providing non-revealing error messages to clients.

## Frontend Development

### 1. Reusable Components (Key Strategy)
*   **Decision**: Prioritize creating and using self-contained, reusable UI components.
*   **Rationale**: Reduces duplication (DRY), ensures UI consistency, improves maintainability.
*   **Consideration**: Requires upfront design effort for flexibility.

### 2. Styling Approach
*   **Current**: Encapsulated CSS per component.
*   **Future Consideration (e.g., Tailwind CSS)**: Utility-first CSS for rapid development and design consistency.
*   **Rationale (Tailwind)**: Speed, consistency, optimized output.
*   **Consideration (Tailwind)**: Verbose HTML, learning curve for utility classes.

### 3. State Management
*   **Current**: Angular services with RxJS (e.g., BehaviorSubjects).
*   **Future Consideration (e.g., NgRx)**: For highly complex, shared application state.
*   **Rationale (NgRx)**: Centralized store, predictable changes, dev tools for complex scenarios.
*   **Consideration (NgRx)**: Significant boilerplate, steep learning curve; overkill for simple state.

### 4. Routing Strategy
*   **Decision**: Utilize Angular's component-based routing, with potential for lazy-loaded modules for feature areas and route guards for access control/navigation logic.
*   **Rationale**: Organizes application into logical views, improves initial load time with lazy loading, and enhances security/UX with route guards.
*   **Consideration**: Requires careful planning of route structure and guard logic to ensure maintainability and correct behavior.

### 5. Frontend Testing Strategy
*   **Decision**: Unit tests for components and services (using Jasmine & Karma).
*   **Rationale**: Verifies UI component behavior, service logic, and critical application paths.
*   **Consideration**: Ensuring meaningful unit test coverage and maintaining tests as the codebase evolves.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 1. Error Handling
*   **Decision**: Centralized frontend error display (e.g., via an `ErrorDisplayComponent` and HTTP interceptors); structured error responses from backend APIs (often facilitated by global exception handling middleware).
*   **Rationale**: Consistent user feedback for errors; aids debugging.
*   **Consideration**: Balancing user-friendly messages with detailed logs for developers; avoiding sensitive data in error responses.

### 2. Logging
*   **Decision**:
    *   **Backend Logging Type**: Uses the default Microsoft.Extensions.Logging system (console/file logging as configured by ASP.NET Core out of the box).
    *   **Frontend Logging Type**: Primarily light client-side console logging for diagnosing frontend-specific issues during development and troubleshooting.
*   **Rationale**: Provides basic logging for diagnostics and monitoring without extra dependencies or configuration.
*   **Consideration**: For advanced scenarios (structured logging, external log aggregation, richer queries), integrating a provider like Serilog or NLog would be beneficial.
